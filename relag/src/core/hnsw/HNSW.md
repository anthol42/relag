## Key design decisions

**Parallelism without a global lock.**
`HGraph` uses one `parking_lot::RwLock` per node. `add_edge` always locks `min(u,v)` before `max(u,v)` — the only deadlock rule. The entry point is a `Mutex<Option<Loc>>` (updated O(log N) times total, contention is negligible).

**Thread-local hot path.**
Each rayon worker owns its `ScratchBuffers` (heaps, bitset, snapshot vecs) and `StdRng`. Nothing shared in the inner loop except the graph locks, the sharded distance cache, and the sharded proximity-edge set.

**Sharded distance cache & proximity-edge set.**
Both `ShardedCache` (distances) and `ShardedEdgeSet` (`proximity_edges`, populated when `keep_all_edges = true`) shard the same way: pair `(i, j)` (with `i ≤ j`) always routes to shard `i & (N-1)` (fast power-of-two modulo on `key.0` — no hashing needed to pick the shard). With 64 shards and 8 threads, the probability of two threads hitting the same shard simultaneously is ~12%, vs 100% for a single shared structure.
`ShardedEdgeSet` uses a plain `Mutex<HashMap<...>>` per shard rather than `DashMap`: the workload is write-mostly with a single full read at the very end (`edges()`/`index()`), never a point lookup mid-build, so `DashMap`'s own internal shard-selection hashing is pure overhead here — we already know the shard from `key.0` alone. The per-shard `HashMap` still dedups redundant re-inserts of the same pair (two different node insertions can independently rediscover the same below-threshold pair) so memory doesn't grow with duplicate writes.

**Snapshot before FFI.**
`neighbors_snapshot()` clones a node's neighbour list under a brief read lock, then releases before calling into the distance function. Holding a lock across FFI would serialize all threads.

**Log-factorial ETA.**
Insert `k` costs O(log k), so total work ∝ log(N!). The progress bar computes `fraction_done = log(i!) / log(N!)` via Stirling's approximation and derives ETA from that — accurate from the first few seconds (5s).

**Neighbour selection strategies.**
Three strategies are available, selected per-insertion via config flags:
- `use_heuristic = true` (default) — `select_neighbors`: Algorithm 4 from the HNSW paper. Candidates are accepted only if they are closer to the query than to any already-selected neighbour, promoting diversity.
- `use_heuristic = false` — `select_neighbors_simple`: Algorithm 3, plain top-`m` by distance. Faster build, lower graph quality.
- `threshold_based_neighbourhood = true` (layer 0 only) — `select_threshold_neighbors`: same heuristic as Algorithm 4 but without a hard upper bound on neighbourhood size. Every candidate whose distance to the query is below `threshold` is kept, with a guaranteed minimum of `m` neighbours. Produces a denser layer 0, which improves proximity-graph recall at the cost of higher memory and build time.

**Query-time search API.**
`HNSWState::search(&T, &mut ScratchBuffers, k, ef_search)` performs nearest-neighbor lookup for an external query (not inserted in the graph). It does a greedy descent on upper layers, then a best-first search on layer 0, and returns `(index, distance)` sorted by ascending distance.

**Node ids are `u32`.**
Every node id (`HGraph` adjacency lists, `Candidate.idx`, `ScratchBuffers` vecs, `proximity_edges`/`ShardedCache` keys, the public search/insert API) is `u32`, not `usize` — halves memory for adjacency/proximity storage and, more importantly, shrinks `Candidate` from 16 to 8 bytes so twice as many candidates fit per cache line in the search/insert heaps. Datasets are assumed to fit under 4B points. `(u32, u32)` map/cache keys use `PairHasher`/`PairBuildHasher` (mod.rs) for their *internal* hashmap bucket placement — packs both halves into a u64 via a shift and OR, then runs one multiply + xor-shift in `finish()` so the packed low-bit entropy (node ids are far smaller than 2^32) actually reaches the high bits hash tables typically rely on. Shard *selection* for `ShardedCache`/`ShardedEdgeSet` never uses this hasher — it's a direct `key.0 & mask`.

**Incremental extension.**
`extend_build` appends new data to an already-built index and inserts only the new indices — existing nodes and edges are untouched. It grows `HGraph`'s dense layer 0 (`resize`) and layer count (`add_layers`) to cover the new, larger dataset, sharing the same layer-budget formula as `HNSWState::new` (`max_layers_for`). Both `HGraph` methods only grow, never shrink, so a call with a smaller size panics rather than silently dropping edges. Requires `build()` to have already run — otherwise the original data would sit in `self.data` without ever being connected into the graph.

**Index format versioning.**
`HNSWIndex` stores the `(major, minor, patch)` crate version at save time. `HNSWState::load` rejects indices saved before v0.1.0 (pre the u32 node-id refactor) with a clear error rather than silently decoding garbage. From v0.1.0 onward the on-disk format is expected to stay stable.
